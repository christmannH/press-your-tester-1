<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

**PRESS YOUR TESTER** is a simple game of luck made for the Web Development Community to have a little fun. 
Because you are a Software Engineer looking to get paid **BIG BUCKS for** the code you wrote. But before you get paid, you have to **PRESS YOUR TESTER!** *(but with this tester is all about luck!)*. First, you answer 3 multiple choice questions to prove your worth, each correct answer gives you 3 chances with the TESTER, a wrong answer will only get you 1 chance each. This tester can find some **NASTY BUGS!** The goal is to make the most money you can without *"bugging out"* -- 3 BUGS in your code and you lose! GOOD LUCK!

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] **MVP Goals**
    - [x] As a player, I want to read the rules of the game so I can understand how to play.
    - [x] As a player, I want to clearly read the questions, make my choice and know if my answer was right or wrong.
    - [x] As a player, I want to know how many chances I will have to PRESS THE TESTER after answering all the questions.
    - [x] As a player, I would like to see the tester moving through the game board randomly and PRESS THE TESTER button to make it stop.
    - [x] As a player, I want to PRESS THE TESTER and see that when I land on a BUG I can lose all the money I have collected.
    - [x] As a player, I would like to choose to stop the game and get the money I collected so far to win the game.
    - [x] As a player, I want to PRESS THE TESTER and run the risk of losing the game if I get 3 BUGS.
    - [x] As a player, I would like to try to run out of chances to PRESS THE TESTER and if I still have money, win the game.
    - [x] As a player, I want to be able to start the game again.

- [x] **Stretch Goals: Bronze**
    - [x] As a player, I would like to experience seeing each box glowing with lights showing where the random move is before I PRESS THE TESTER.
    - [x] As a player, I recognize that the game's aesthetics and design resemble the original game show.   
    - [x] - As a player, I would like to hear sound effects when the tester moves around the board so I can feel the anticipation to PRESS THE TESTER.

- [ ] **Stretch Goals: Silver**
    - [ ] As a player, I would like the UI to be appealing with images indicating the value of each box.
    - [ ] As a player, I would like to see each box switching between 3 other values so I can have more random chances to win or lose.
    - [ ] - As a player, I would like to see animations and hear sounds so I know when I win or lose the round.

- [ ] **Stretch Goals: Gold**
    - [ ] As a player, I would like to play this game with a friend and PASS THE TESTER to give my opponent a chance to lose.
    - [ ] As a player, I would like to enable my web camera in the middle so the experience looks like the original game show.
    - [ ] As a player, I would like to play online so I don't have to have my opponent sitting next to me.
    - [ ] As a player, I would like to see a scoreboard showing who is the Software Engineer that got paid the most of all time.
